<p>This demo very simply shows the binding of textures. When it is first loaded, no texture is bound and the
quad's color is set to [1,1,1,1] -- or full white. After a 1.0 second delay, the texture will be retrieved
from the server and bound to the quad. At this time, the shader is changed from 'color_without_texture' to
'color_with_texture' and the texture should be visible.</p>
